NOTE
----

This is still under development and needs to be thoroughly tested before it
can actually be used. The concepts have been tested but the form that the code
is currently in has not. Also, a renaming is in process from *pyphp* to
*pyemphp* because *pyphp* is already taken by several projects related to
Python and PHP.
